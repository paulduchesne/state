# Personal data as PREMIS. 

**Introduction**

I have long been interested in the concept of publishing personal data as an open knowledge graph, and as counterpoint to the accumulation of such data by others. 

[PREMIS](https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/) is explicitly intended as a framework for activity and characteristics related to digital preservation, but appears flexible enough to document such personal information.
